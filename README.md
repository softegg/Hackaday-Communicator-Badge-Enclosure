This is a set of 3d models for a badge enclosure for the "Communicator" meshtastic badge for Hackaday Supercon 2025. This badge will also be used for Hackaday Berlin 2026 around April or March, so please enjoy it there too!

I have included the original Autodesk Fusion 360 File, as well as STL and STEP files for all models.
There is a front and back, and a switch.
Hopefully everything fits together ok... I don't have a badge to test with.
I can't actually come to Supercon anymore because I can't return to the US anymore...

It *should* work with the screws that they included. I'm told they are M2 8mm machine screws. But if those don't work, a self-tapping M2 screw should probably be fine. You might be good up to M2.5, but use at your own risk. This is plastic, so you can strip it out pretty easily if you try. Don't try.

***A note from Tinabel***\
I really enjoy creating electronic enclosures, much more than writing code or designing electronics, so if anybody has projects needing enclosures, I am available for hire. 

Since moving to Germany, I kinda have to appease the German government by earning money and paying taxes, so it would be really handy to have some paying work I actually enjoy to do.

And, because of some strangeness about health insurance, I have to only make that money doing artistic things. Fortunately, industrial design is an artistic thing! So, if you like this enclosure, please help a girl out and give me some paying work! I recently found out that I don't have to limit my work to companies in Germany as I was previously told, so I'm looking forward to working with everybody again!

Thanks for enjoying my enclosures. Sorry it takes so long to make them.

I can be found most evenings at X-Hain hack+make space in Friedrichshain, Berlin! Come visit! 

Your friend in exile,
